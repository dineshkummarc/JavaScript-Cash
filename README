Cash.js is a javascript image caching library to be used as an addon to a web page.  Cash uses HTML5 offline storage to convert images into strings and save them in the browser's memory

Best used when called from another function, such as "game.js"

var Game = {
	initTimer: 0, //holds id of main game timer

	prepareInit: function() { //waits until other js is loaded and ready before initing the game
		var interval = 1000;
		Game.initTimer = setInterval(Game.checkInitReady, interval);
	},
	checkInitReady: function() { //waits until other js is loaded and ready before initing the game
		if (Cash.is_ready) {
			console.log("Cash ready, starting game.");
			clearInterval(Game.initTimer);
			Game.initGame();
		} else {
			console.log("Cash not ready, waiting...");
		}
	},
	initGame: function() {
		....
	}
}
